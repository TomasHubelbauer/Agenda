### Roadmap

- Address [TODO comments](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/agenda/search?q=todo) continuously
- [ ] Allow switching to a multi-line editor and split into title and description (for links etc.)
- [ ] Allow attaching images (maybe check for size for now to not bust local cache)
- [ ] Consider switching to IndexedDB for more appropriate storage for attachments or all data
- [ ] Create and add a favicon
- [ ] Get a custom domain to have own local storage, not `github.io` one
- [ ] Convert to a PWA: [Progressive Web Apps on iOS are here](https://medium.com/@firt/progressive-web-apps-on-ios-are-here-d00430dee3a7)
- [ ] Validate PWA pinning to home screen works on iOS, with icons and standalone window
- [ ] Create iOS home screen icons: https://stackoverflow.com/a/26369790
